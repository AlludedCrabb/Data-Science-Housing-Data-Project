# Home Price Prediction Project

This is the repository for Jacob Crabb and Taeho Jeon's Flatiron School end of module 1 project.

Our assignment is in 3 parts: 

1. to use the kc_house_data.csv and it's description file, column_names.md, to make a model for predicting home sale prices.

2. to make a powerpoint/keynote/google slides presentation explaining our model

3. to write a blog concerning our project and post it for other aspiring data scientists to see.

## Business understanding/the problem we're fixing:
we are to make a model that will predict home price based on costomer needs like number of bedrooms, 
number of bathrooms,location, and others.

## Data understanding/what are we working with:
we are provided two years of housing data from king county in the kc_house_data.csv file to work with.
and are allowed to pull from other sources as needed.
    
## Data preperation/Data cleaning:
we check for duplicates, correct missing or incorrect values, and remove outliers.
    
## Modeling:
we build functions to perfom train/test splits and cross validation.
then we test out different predictors with sklearn feature selection.
    
## Evaluation:
we test our model in general, on areas outside of Seattle,
inside of Seattle and on each individual zip code.
we then show the results for each area.
    
## Deployment:
we build a usable predictor function based on our model.
then add some final conclusions about our model.

## Future:
it would be nice at some point to iron out the weaknesses of our model
and make improvements to the code.
